const e=`His laptop sat on his desk.\r
\r
His laptop always overheated.\r
\r
It always overheated quickly.\r
\r
How could he keep it cool?\r
\r
He turned on his living room fan.\r
\r
It cooled his laptop.\r
\r
But the fan blew dust around.\r
\r
It blew paper around.\r
\r
He turned off his living room fan.\r
\r
He thought. He thought some more.\r
\r
How could he keep his laptop cool?\r
\r
He had an idea.\r
\r
He bought little plastic blocks.\r
\r
Each block was one inch square.\r
\r
He put the laptop on top of the blocks.\r
\r
One block was under each corner of the laptop.\r
\r
Now the laptop sat a little above the desk.\r
\r
There was space under the laptop.\r
\r
There was space for cool air to flow.\r
\r
The cool air prevented overheating.`;export{e as default};

const n=`I go into my bathroom sometime around 6:45 a. m.\r
\r
My sink and medicine cabinet are on the left when you enter my bathroom.\r
\r
The toilet is next to that, with the tub in front.\r
\r
Anyway, I turn on the lights, and try to find the mouthwash in the medicine cabinet.\r
\r
I pour a small amount into a cup, swish it around for 30 seconds, gargle, and spit.\r
\r
Not pleasant, but necessary.\r
\r
Then I get out the floss.\r
\r
When I'm done flossing, I pull out the toothbrush and the toothpaste.\r
\r
I brush and then it's off to the shower.\r
\r
I pull the shower curtain aside, step into the tub, and pull the curtain back.\r
\r
I turn on both the hot and the cold water, looking for the perfect temperature.\r
\r
I lather up with soap, put some shampoo in my hair, then rinse and dry off.\r
\r
Now it's shaving time.\r
\r
I used to own an electric razor, but I found it didn't shave close enough.\r
\r
So now I'm back to the old hand razor.\r
\r
I lather up with shaving cream, and I start to shave.\r
\r
I rinse the razor and throw the disposable blades in the trash.\r
\r
It's about 7:00 AM, and I'm on to breakfast.`;export{n as default};

const e=`The good thing is that it doesn't have to be like this.\r
There is nothing wrong with you. You can learn to speak English naturally and with ease.\r
You can use English effectively in your job, travels, and studies.\r
You can feel relaxed and confident every time you speak English.\r
In fact, as a long-time English teacher, I've helped thousands of students all over the world become fluent and powerful English speakers.\r
How did I do it? I did it using a teaching method I developed called Effortless English.\r
Effortless English enables you to learn English naturally and automatically â€“ the way children learn before they enter school.\r
Too often, English classes get so focused on tests, textbooks, grades and "levels," students forget why they're there in the first place.\r
They forget about the real world goals of a more successful career and exciting international travel.\r
With Effortless English you never lose sight of the fact that the ultimate goal of learning a language is communication.\r
Instead, you learn to speak English both quickly and with more precision.`;export{e as default};

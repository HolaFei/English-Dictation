const e=`If you've picked up this book, chances are you've wanted to speak English for a while. Maybe you've even taken classes.\r
You probably need English to improve your career.\r
Maybe you want to travel internationally or study abroad.\r
You know that English is the key to international business and international travel.\r
So let me ask you something.\r
Do you feel nervous or shy when you try to speak English?\r
Do you still struggle to understand what someone is saying to you despite years of study?\r
Are you embarrassed about your pronunciation or worried you speak too slowly?\r
Are you frustrated that despite all the time you've invested in learning English you still can't speak it?\r
Despite your goals, is it difficult for you to actually use English in your job, travels, or studies?\r
Do you sometimes feel that you'll never master spoken English?\r
If you answered yes to any of these questions, you're not alone.\r
In fact, you're fairly typical. Most English students feel this way.\r
Most adult English learners are stressed and frustrated about their speaking ability.\r
Some feel completely hopeless and feel they'll never be able to speak English powerfully.\r
Not because they're bad at languages, but because, like you, they've been taught using the wrong methods.`;export{e as default};

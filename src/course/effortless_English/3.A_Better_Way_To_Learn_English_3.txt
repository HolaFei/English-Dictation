Effortless?
I understand if you're skeptical â€“ particularly if you've been trying to learn English the traditional way.
You've put in the hours: memorizing vocabulary lists, doing grammar drills, reading boring textbooks.
"How?" you're thinking, "can speaking English possibly be effortless?"
Believe me, I feel your pain.
Back when I started teaching 15 years ago, my students were all excited to begin conversing in English.
And I was excited to help them.
At that time, I taught in the usual way.
I used textbooks and I focused on teaching grammar.
I thought this was the best way to teach, and none of my students complained.
I still remember one particularly intelligent student of mine from Venezuela named Gladys.
Gladys was determined to speak English well.
Talk about effort!
Gladys attended every one of my classes.
She always sat in the center of the front row.
I can still picture her eager and smiling face.
She took detailed notes.
She listened to every word I said.
She also studied at home.
Every day Gladys studied her English textbooks for four hours or more.
She also tried to learn 50 new vocabulary words by memorizing word lists.
Gladys was my star student and I, too, was sure she would succeed.

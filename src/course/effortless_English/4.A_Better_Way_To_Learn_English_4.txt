Six months later, however, she still could barely speak English.
Her speech was hesitant and unnatural.
She constantly made grammar mistakes with even the simplest sentences.
Her pronunciation was difficult to understand.
She still thought in Spanish and tried to translate to and from English when she spoke.
Worst of all, Gladys felt nervous every time she tried to speak English.
Speaking English was a painful experience for her.
Gladys was extremely frustrated.
After so much effort, she had barely improved.
As her teacher, I too was frustrated.
I was sure Gladys would improve quickly and couldn't understand why she had not.
I followed all of the traditional teaching methods.
I used the standard textbooks and the standard classroom activities. 
Gladys was intelligent, disciplined and consistent, and yet her English speaking barely improved.

My school life is colorful. Every morning, I ride my bike to school and chat with my friends in the classroom. We often read books and solve math problems together in the library after class.
I love sports very much. On weekends, I usually play basketball or football with my classmates in the park. It makes me feel happy and healthy.
English is my favorite subject. I enjoy learning new words and sentences, and I can always get good grades in English tests. I hope to become an excellent English speaker one day!
